═══ SIGIL ENGINEERING WORKFLOW — BUILD COMPLETE ═══

Plugin: sigil-engineering-workflow v1.0.0
Status: All self-tests passing (7/7), committed, pushed to GitHub

5 skills:
- plan-execute     — Verified, risk-assessed implementation plans
- test-doctor      — Language-agnostic test fixing with regression snapshots  
- safe-commit      — Security-gated git (no git add ., secret scanning)
- review-apply     — PR feedback with TDD for bugs
- solution-ensemble — 3-agent parallel with 5-dimension evaluation

2 agents:
- plan-executor    — Language detection, no hardcoded tool assumptions
- secret-scanner   — Fast staged-file security pattern matching

2 commands:
- help             — List all skills and activation phrases
- version          — Display plugin version

3 scripts:
- self-test.sh     — 7 integrity checks (7/7 passing)
- detect-secrets.sh — 13 secret patterns
- version.sh       — Single source of truth enforcement

7 fixed issues:
1. No moat → Each skill is a multi-agent protocol, not a prompt
2. Tooling lock-in → Language-agnostic framework detection
3. Security gaps → Secret scanning before every git operation
4. Zero tests → Self-test.sh with 7 integrity checks
5. No discoverability → Help and version commands
6. Version drift → VERSION file = single source of truth
7. No recovery → Retry with exponential backoff

Next: Synthesize 360 review of marketplace audiences → choose launch strategy
